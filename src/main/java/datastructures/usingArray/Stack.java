/*
    All Implemented Interfaces:

    Serializable: It is a marker interface that classes must implement if they are to be serialized and deserialized.
            Cloneable: This is an interface in Java which needs to be implemented by a class to allow its objects to be cloned.
    Iterable<E>: This interface represents a collection of objects which is iterable â€” meaning which can be iterated.
            Collection<E>: A Collection represents a group of objects known as its elements. The Collection interface is used to pass around collections of objects where maximum generality is desired.
    List<E>: The List interface provides a way to store the ordered collection. It is a child interface of Collection.
    RandomAccess: This is a marker interface used by List implementations to indicate that they support fast (generally constant time) random access.
